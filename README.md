Dataset for the manuscript,"The pathway-flow relative permeability of CO2: Measurement by lowered pressure drops" , submitted to journal Water Resource Research. 2017-07-02.

The ".vsz" figure file can be viewed by the excellent open source package, Veusz (https://veusz.github.io/). 
In the ".vsz" file, the data for plotting is available. 

The forward simulation in the manuscript is performed using  an online two-phase fluid flow simulator-SCAL (http://www.jgmaas.com/), developed on the basis of an open-source code DUMUX [Flemisch et al., 2011] for special core analyses [Maas et al., 2011].The modeling parameters are outlined in Table 1 in the manuscript. The modeling can be readily replicated using the SCAL simulator with the simulation parameters.
